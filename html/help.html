                    <p>Welcome to the help page for Join, your guide to using our kanban project management tool. Here,
                        we'll
                        provide an
                        overview of what Join is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.</p>

                    <h2>What is Join?</h2>
                    <p>Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated
                        students
                        as part
                        of their
                        web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.

                        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work,
                        limit
                        work-in-progress,
                        and maximize efficiency (or flow). Join leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage
                        their tasks
                        and
                        projects in an intuitive, visual interface.

                        It is important to note that Join is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for
                        extensive
                        business
                        usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee
                        consistent
                        availability,
                        reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding Join.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How to use it</h2>
                    <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Join:</p>
                    <h3>1.
                        Exploring the Board</h3>
                    <p>When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project and
                        contains four
                        default
                        lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</p>
                    <h3>2.
                        Creating Contacts</h3>
                    <p>In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section,
                        click
                        on "New
                        contact",
                        and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they
                        can
                        interact
                        with
                        the tasks on the board.</p>
                    <h3>3.
                        Adding Cards</h3>
                    <p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual
                        tasks.
                        Click the
                        "+"
                        button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card,
                        like
                        task
                        name,
                        description, due date, assignees, etc.</p>
                    <h3>4.
                        Moving Cards</h3>
                    <p>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and
                        dropping the
                        card
                        from one list to another.</p>
                    <h3>5.
                        Deleting Cards</h3>
                    <p>Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a
                        card
                        will
                        permanently
                        remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is
                        irreversible.

                        Remember that using Join effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team to
                        ensure
                        the board
                        reflects
                        the current state of your project.
